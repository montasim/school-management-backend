 * @fileoverview Email Sending Service
 *
 * This service module provides functionality to send emails using nodemailer. It is configured to use specific email service
 * settings defined in the system's environment variables. The service includes a function for sending emails to a default or specified
 * email address, with the flexibility to set the subject and HTML content of the email. The module imports the required configuration
 * from "../config/config.js" and uses a logger from "../shared/logger.js" for logging purposes.

/**
 * Sends an email to the specified or default email address.
 *
 * This asynchronous function uses nodemailer to create a transporter object configured with the system's email service settings.
 * It sends an email to either a specified address or a default destination email address, with the given subject and HTML content.
 * The function handles errors by logging them and returning the error object. It is useful for automated email notifications
 * or alerts within the system.
 *
 * @async
 * @param {string} [emailAddress=EMAIL_SERVICE_DESTINATION_EMAIL] - The recipient's email address. Defaults to the system's configured destination email.
 * @param {string} subject - The subject of the email.
 * @param {string} html - The HTML content of the email.
 * @throws {Error} - Throws an error if there is an issue with sending the email.
 * @returns {Promise<void>} - A promise that resolves when the email is sent successfully.
