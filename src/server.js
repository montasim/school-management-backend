/**
 * @fileoverview Server Initialization and Configuration Module.
 *
 * This module is responsible for initializing and starting the Express server.
 * It imports the configured Express application from 'app.js' and starts listening
 * for incoming requests on a specified port. This module logs the server start
 * message and port number to provide visibility on the server status and acts as
 * the entry point for running the application server.
 *
 * Global handlers for 'uncaughtException', 'SIGTERM', and 'SIGINT' signals are also
 * set up to ensure graceful shutdown and resource management.
 *
 * @requires app - The configured Express application.
 * @requires PORT - The port number on which the server will listen.
 * @requires SERVER_LOG_MESSAGE - A message to be logged when the server starts.
 * @requires logger - A logging utility for logging messages.
 * @requires DatabaseMiddleware - Middleware for database connectivity.
 * @module server - Server initialization and configuration.
