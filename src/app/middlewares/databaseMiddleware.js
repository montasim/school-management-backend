/**
 * @fileoverview MongoDB Connection Middleware Module.
 *
 * This module provides middleware functions for connecting to and disconnecting from a MongoDB database using the MongoClient from the "mongodb" package.
 * It ensures the reuse of a single MongoClient instance across the application for efficient database interactions. The module imports configuration
 * settings from "../../config/config.js" and a logger utility from "../../shared/logger.js" for logging purposes.
 *
 * The module exports an object `DatabaseMiddleware` containing the middleware functions `connect` and `disconnect`.

 * is created and reused throughout the application, following the singleton pattern. This approach helps in managing database connections efficiently
 * and avoiding the overhead of establishing multiple connections. The function connects the client to the database using the URI provided in the
 * configuration file and sets options for `useNewUrlParser` and `useUnifiedTopology` to enable the new URL parser and the unified topology layer
 * respectively.

 * @returns {Promise<MongoClient>} A promise that resolves to the MongoClient instance, connected to the database.
