/**
 * @fileoverview Dashboard Routes Module.
 *
 * This module configures the routing for dashboard-related features within an Express application. It incorporates routing for both photo and video
 * galleries, organizing these under distinct base paths for clarity and ease of access. The module imports route handlers from separate modules
 * for photo and video galleries and maps them to their respective paths. This setup facilitates a clear and manageable structure for handling
 * dashboard-related requests in the application.
