/**
 * @fileoverview Constants for Level ID Generation and Validation.
 *
 * This module exports a set of constants used throughout the application for managing Level IDs.
 * These constants include a designated prefix for Level IDs, and defined minimum and maximum lengths.
 * They play a crucial role in standardizing the format of Level IDs across the application,
 * ensuring consistency in ID structure and facilitating easier validation and management of these identifiers.
 *
 * The constants defined here are used in various parts of the application, particularly in validation schemas,
 * and wherever Level IDs are generated or processed. This centralized definition of ID-related constants
 * helps maintain uniformity and reduces the likelihood of errors in ID handling.
 *
 * @module LEVEL_CONSTANTS - Exports constants for Level ID management.
