/**
 * @fileoverview WebsiteBanner Routes for Express Application.
 *
 * This module defines the routes for websiteBanner-related operations in the Express application.
 * It includes endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting websiteBanner posts.
 * The routes are configured with necessary middleware for authentication, file uploading,
 * and validation. Swagger documentation annotations are also included to describe each
 * endpoint, its expected parameters, and responses. This setup facilitates clear and
 * organized handling of websiteBanner-related requests, ensuring proper authentication, data validation,
 * and response structuring.
 *
 * @requires express - Express framework to define routes.
 * @requires authTokenMiddleware - Middleware for authenticating tokens in requests.
 * @requires fileUploadMiddleware - Middleware for handling file uploads.
 * @requires WebsiteBannerValidationService - Validators for websiteBanner post request data.
 * @requires WebsiteBannerController - Controllers for handling websiteBanner post operations.
 * @module websiteBannerRouter - Express router with defined routes for websiteBanner operations.
