 * specification and JSDoc comments for internal code documentation.
 *
 * @requires express Express - Express framework for building web applications
 * @requires authTokenMiddleware - Middleware for authenticating tokens
 * @requires fileUploadMiddleware - Middleware for handling file uploads
 * @requires DownloadValidationService - Service for validating download-related parameters
 * @requires DownloadController - Controller for handling download-related operations
 * @module downloadRouter - Express router for download routes
