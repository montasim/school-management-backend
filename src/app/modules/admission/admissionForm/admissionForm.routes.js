 * specification and JSDoc comments for internal code documentation.
 *
 * @requires express Express - Express framework for building web applications
 * @requires authTokenMiddleware - Middleware for authenticating tokens
 * @requires fileUploadMiddleware - Middleware for handling file uploads
 * @requires AdmissionFormValidationService - Service for validating admissionForm-related parameters
 * @requires AdmissionFormController - Controller for handling admissionForm-related operations
