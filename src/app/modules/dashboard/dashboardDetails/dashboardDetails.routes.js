/**
 * @fileoverview Routes for the Dashboard Details Module.
 *
 * This module sets up the Express router for the dashboard-related routes in the application.
 * It includes endpoints for fetching system summaries and other dashboard-related data.
 * The routes are secured with authentication middleware to ensure that only authenticated
 * users can access them. Each route is associated with a controller function from the
 * DashboardSummaryController module, which contains the logic to handle the specific requests.
 *
 * @requires express - Express framework to create router handlers.
 * @requires authTokenMiddleware - Middleware to authenticate and authorize users.
 * @requires DashboardDetailsController - Controller module for dashboard-related operations.
 * @module dashboardRoutes - Express router instance for dashboard routes.
