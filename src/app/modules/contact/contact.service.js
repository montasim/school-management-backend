/**
 * @fileoverview Service for Handling Email Sending Operations in Express Application.
 *
 * This module exports the `ContactService`, which includes the `sendEmailService` function.
 * The `sendEmailService` is an asynchronous function designed to handle email sending operations.
 * It constructs email content based on provided details like the sender's name, phone number, email, subject,
 * and message. The service uses a helper function `sendEmailToProvidedEmailAddress` to send emails to both
 * the school management and the sender, confirming the receipt of their message. It is designed to be used by
 * the controller layer for processing email sending requests.
 *
 * @module ContactService - Exported services for handling email sending operations.
 * @requires sendEmailToProvidedEmailAddress - Helper function to send emails.
 * @requires generateResponseData - Utility to generate standardized response data.
 * @requires config - Configuration settings including email recipient details.
 * @requires logger - Shared logging utility for error logging.
