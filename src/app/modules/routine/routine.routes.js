/**
 * @fileoverview Express router providing routine-related routes.
 *
 * This module defines routes for creating, retrieving, and deleting routines.
 * It includes middleware for authentication, file upload handling, and specific validations
 * related to routine operations. Each route is documented using Swagger annotations for API
 * specification and JSDoc comments for internal code documentation.
 *
 * @requires express Express - Express framework for building web applications
 * @requires authTokenMiddleware - Middleware for authenticating tokens
 * @requires fileUploadMiddleware - Middleware for handling file uploads
 * @requires RoutineValidationService - Service for validating routine-related parameters
 * @requires RoutineController - Controller for handling routine-related operations
 * @module routineRouter - Express router for routine routes
