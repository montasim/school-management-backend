/**
 * @fileoverview Controllers for the Routine Module.
 *
 * This module contains controller functions for handling routine-related operations in the application.
 * It includes controllers for creating new routines, fetching a list of all routines, retrieving a specific
 * routine by ID, and deleting a routine. Each controller function is designed to be asynchronous and handles
 * the request-response cycle for its respective route, including extracting relevant data from the request,
 * validating file uploads, and interfacing with the RoutineService to perform business logic operations.
 *
 * @requires RoutineService - Service for handling routine-related business logic.
 * @requires extractFromRequest - Helper function for extracting data from the request object.
 * @requires validateStringField - Helper function for validating file title.
 * @requires validateUploadedFile - Helper function for validating uploaded files.
 * @requires handleServiceResponse - Helper function for handling responses from services.
 * @requires logger - Shared logging utility.
 * @requires constants - Application constants, including MAX_PDF_FILE_SIZE and MIME_TYPE_PDF.
 * @module RoutineController - Exported object containing routine-related controller functions.
