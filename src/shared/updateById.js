/**
 * @fileoverview Database Update Utility for Specific IDs in Collections.
 *
 * This module provides a function for updating database records based on a given ID within a specified collection.
 * It is designed to handle updates to various entities within different collections in a uniform and efficient manner.
 * The function receives the target collection's name, the ID of the entity to be updated, and the new details for the update.
 * It then applies these updates to the appropriate database record. This utility is crucial for maintaining up-to-date
 * and accurate information across the application's database.
 *
 * @requires DatabaseMiddleware - Middleware for database interactions.
 * @requires logger - Utility for logging errors.
 * @module updateById - Exported function for updating records in a collection by ID.
