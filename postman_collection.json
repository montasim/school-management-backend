		"description": "The School Management API is a robust and comprehensive backend system designed for educational institutions, developed using Node.js and Express.js. It centralizes various aspects of school management, such as administrative tasks, student information, blog updates, and more. A key feature is its strong user authentication system, providing secure login, signup, and password management. The API includes modules for diverse school activities, ranging from administration to blog and announcement management.\n\nIntegration with Google Drive is a significant aspect, enabling efficient file management across different modules. Security and compliance are prioritized, with advanced authentication, role-based access control, and adherence to data protection standards, ensuring the safety of sensitive information.\n\nThe APIs technology stack includes MongoDB, Bcrypt, CORS, Jsonwebtoken, Multer, Nodemailer, and Swagger, providing a comprehensive set of tools for database management, security, file handling, and documentation. The project is structured for easy development and maintenance, with clear directory organization and environment-specific configurations. Hosted on Vercel, it offers seamless deployment. Overall, the School Management API is a versatile and efficient solution for modern educational institutions, embodying both operational efficiency and technological advancement.",
